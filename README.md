to project the value of these homes across each borough. </p>

### Conclusion

<p>When look to settle in New York, buyers will be faced with some of the highest prices in the U.S. Buyers 
can expect to pay almost $1 million dollars for real estate. However, if living in one of the five boroughs in 
New York City is a requirement, on pricing alone, The Bronx provides a lower cost opportunity to acquire property.</p>
